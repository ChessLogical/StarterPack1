The file-encrypter program is a command line utility that allows a user to encrypt or decrypt the contents of a file using a password.
The program is designed with security and memory safety in mind, and it employs several best practices to achieve these goals.

When the program is run, the user is prompted to enter the file name and password. The program reads these inputs from standard input 
and trims any whitespace characters to remove any leading or trailing spaces.

The program then checks if the file exists and retrieves its size. If the file is not found, the program returns an error.

To read the file contents, the program uses a BufReader to read the file in chunks rather than loading the entire file into memory at once.
This helps prevent the program from running out of memory when processing large files.

The program then encrypts or decrypts the file contents byte by byte using a loop that XORs each byte with a corresponding byte from 
the password. The encrypted or decrypted bytes are stored in a new vector.

To write the encrypted or decrypted contents back to the file, the program uses a BufWriter to write the contents in chunks rather
than writing the entire contents at once. This helps prevent buffer overflows and other memory safety issues.

After the file has been encrypted or decrypted and written back to disk, the program zeros out any sensitive data that was stored in
memory, such as the file name, password, file contents, and encrypted or decrypted contents. This helps prevent information leakage 
if the memory is later reused for other purposes.

Overall, the file-encrypter program is designed to be secure and memory safe by employing best practices such as reading 
and writing files in chunks, using vectors to store file contents, and zeroing out sensitive data after use.




Prompting the user for the password is generally considered better for security than having it provided all at once. 
This is because if the password is provided as a command line argument, it may be visible in process listings, command histories, 
or other logs, which can be a security risk.

Prompting the user for the password also allows the user to enter the password securely, such as by copying and pasting it from a
password manager or using a trusted input method. This can help prevent the password from being intercepted by malicious software or hardware.

In general, it's a good practice to prompt the user for sensitive information, such as passwords or authentication tokens, rather
than requiring them to provide it as a command line argument or other input method that could expose it to risk.

There are several ways this program could be made more memory safe and reliable:

Use safer zeroization techniques: The program uses zeroize() to zero out sensitive data. However, zeroize() only overwrites the data with zeroes, leaving it vulnerable to memory attacks. A more secure approach would be to use Rust's sodiumoxide library, which provides a sodiumoxide::sodium::memzero() function that securely zeroes out memory by overwriting it with random data.

Handle errors more gracefully: The program uses unwrap() and expect() in several places to handle errors. While these methods are convenient, they can cause the program to panic if an error occurs, which is not ideal. A better approach would be to use match or if let statements to handle errors more gracefully and provide more helpful error messages to the user.

Use a more secure encryption algorithm: The program uses a simple XOR encryption algorithm, which is not very secure. A more secure approach would be to use a standard encryption algorithm like AES or RSA, which are more difficult to crack.

Validate user input: The program prompts the user for a file name and a password, but does not validate the input. This could lead to errors or security vulnerabilities if the user enters invalid input. A better approach would be to validate the input using regular expressions or other methods to ensure that it meets certain criteria, such as length or format.

Use a better file handling approach: The program uses BufReader and BufWriter to read and write the file contents, respectively. While these methods are efficient, they are not very reliable if the file is very large. A better approach would be to use Rust's File API directly and read and write the file contents in smaller, more manageable chunks. This would help to prevent memory errors and improve the program's reliability.
