# Vec<u8> encrypt
[dependencies] none!



This script uses the std::fs::File and std::io modules to read and write files, and prompts the user for input using the std::io::stdin() function. It reads the contents of the specified
file into a Vec<u8>, encrypts or decrypts the contents using a simple XOR cipher with the specified password, and writes the encrypted or decrypted 
contents back to the file.

Note that this is just a simple example and should not be used for real-world encryption. For real-world encryption, you should use a well-vetted 
encryption library like rust-crypto or ring.

The script prompts the user to enter a file name and reads the user's input using the std::io::stdin() function.

The script prompts the user to enter a password and reads the user's input using the std::io::stdin() function.

The script trims any whitespace from the user's input using the String::trim() method.

The script opens the specified file using the std::fs::File::open() function and reads its contents into a Vec<u8> using the std::io::Read::read_to_end() method.

The script initializes a new empty Vec<u8> to hold the encrypted or decrypted contents of the file.

The script loops through each byte in the file contents, XORs it with the corresponding byte in the password (using modular arithmetic to repeat the password as
necessary), and adds the result to the encrypted or decrypted contents vector.

The script opens the specified file using the std::fs::File::create() function and writes the encrypted or decrypted contents of the file back to the file 
using the std::io::Write::write_all() method.

The script returns an Ok(()) value to indicate that the operation completed successfully.

The script uses Rust's standard library modules std::fs::File and std::io to read and write files, and uses the std::io::stdin() function to prompt the user for input.
It also uses basic Rust features like loops, vectors, and modular arithmetic to implement a simple XOR cipher for encryption and decryption.

The password length is not explicitly limited in the Rust script provided earlier.

However, the script uses the password as an array of bytes, with each byte corresponding to a single character in the password. This means that the maximum length of
the password is limited by the maximum size of a Rust u8 type, which is 255.

In practice, it's generally a good idea to limit the length of passwords to a reasonable maximum to prevent users from entering excessively long passwords 
that may slow down the encryption or decryption process or cause memory issues. A common maximum length for passwords is 128 characters, although this can 
vary depending on the specific requirements of your application.
