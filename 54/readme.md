Ko=nown bug--- if files already exist like 8.jpg and 9.jpg it does not process in order properly-- will fix that later and implement extensive error checking-----------
asks for file extention without the "."  for teample jpg.  Renames every jpg in current directory, starts with 1.jpg and numbers all in sequence. for example 2.jpg 3.jpg
