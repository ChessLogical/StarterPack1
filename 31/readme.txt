Below is a complete example of a simple console-based password manager in Rust. Please remember that this is a basic example meant for educational purposes and not intended for actual use to manage your passwords, as it lacks proper security measures.

This code provides a simple text-based interface to add, list, save, and load password entries. The password entries are serialized to JSON format and stored in a file in the userâ€™s home directory. The passwords are stored in plaintext in this example, which is not secure for a real-world application.

A production-grade password manager should use strong encryption to store passwords and other sensitive information, and it should securely handle encryption keys and user passwords in memory.
