This Rust application is designed to securely encrypt and decrypt files using a simple XOR-based method with a key file. The program requires three command-line arguments: the action ('E' for encryption or 'D' for decryption), the data filename, and the key filename. The main function initializes the process by calling the run function, which handles argument parsing, validation, and subsequent file operations. If any errors occur during the execution, they are printed to the standard error output, and the program exits with a non-zero status.

In the run function, the command-line arguments are collected into a vector. The program checks if the correct number of arguments is provided. If not, it prints a usage message and exits. It then extracts the action, data filename, and key filename from the arguments and checks for the existence of these files. If either file does not exist, an appropriate error is returned. To prevent simultaneous access by multiple processes, the program creates a lock file in the same directory as the data file. This lock file ensures that only one instance of the program can process the file at a time. The LockFileGuard struct manages this lock file, ensuring it is removed when the program finishes processing.

The process_file function is responsible for the actual encryption or decryption. It first creates temporary filenames for intermediate processing and checksum storage. It then opens the data and key files, setting up buffered readers for efficient file access. A temporary file is also created to store the processed data. The function reads the data and key files in chunks, performing an XOR operation between corresponding bytes. This XOR operation is the core of the encryption and decryption process. The same operation is used for both, as XORing the encrypted data with the same key will produce the original data.

To ensure data integrity, a simple checksum mechanism is implemented using the SimpleHasher struct. The hasher updates its checksum value with each byte of processed data. During encryption, the computed checksum is saved to a checksum file. During decryption, the program reads the original checksum from this file and compares it to the newly computed checksum. If the checksums do not match, it indicates a data integrity issue, and the program returns an error.

After processing the entire file, the temporary file containing the processed data is renamed to replace the original data file. If the action is encryption, the checksum file is created. If the action is decryption, the checksum file is verified and then deleted. The program prints appropriate messages to indicate the successful completion of the encryption or decryption process.

The SimpleHasher struct provides a basic but effective method for computing a checksum by adding the byte values of the data. The LockFileGuard struct ensures that the lock file is removed when the program completes, preventing stale lock files from blocking future operations.

Overall, this application provides a robust and straightforward method for file encryption and decryption. It includes comprehensive error handling to ensure reliability and data safety. The use of temporary files and checksums adds an extra layer of integrity verification, making the application suitable for secure file processing.
