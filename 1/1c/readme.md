This Rust application is designed to securely encrypt or decrypt a file using a key file, ensuring robust error handling and preventing data corruption. The application takes three command-line arguments: an action (either "E" for encrypt or "D" for decrypt), the filename of the data file, and the filename of the key file. It begins by creating a lock file to ensure that no other processes can access the data file concurrently, which helps maintain data integrity during the operation.

Before performing the encryption or decryption, the application validates that the key file is at least as long as the data file. If the key file is shorter, the application exits with an error message, preventing any partial processing that could lead to corrupted data. This length check is crucial because the encryption method (XOR) requires each byte of the data file to have a corresponding byte in the key file.

The application processes the file in chunks to handle potentially large files efficiently. It reads data from the data file and the key file in 4096-byte chunks, performing an XOR operation on each byte of the data chunk with the corresponding byte of the key chunk. This processed data is then written to a temporary file. Using a temporary file ensures that the original data file is only replaced if the entire process completes successfully, further reducing the risk of data corruption.

After processing all the data, the application flushes the output to ensure all data is written to the temporary file, and then renames the temporary file to the original filename. This atomic operation guarantees that the data file is only updated when the new content is fully ready. Finally, the lock file is removed, allowing other processes to access the data file again. Throughout the process, the application provides clear error messages and performs necessary cleanup to maintain a high standard of reliability and safety, making it suitable for production use.
