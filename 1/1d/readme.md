Overview
This Rust program provides a simple implementation of a file encryption and decryption utility using the XOR cipher method. It takes three command-line arguments: an action (E for encryption or D for decryption), the name of the data file to be processed, and the name of the key file. The key file must be at least as long as the data file to ensure that every byte of the data file can be XORed with a corresponding byte from the key file.

Features
The utility ensures that only one instance can process a given file at a time by creating a lock file (<filename>.lock) in the same directory as the data file. This lock file prevents other processes from accessing the same file concurrently, thereby avoiding potential data corruption. Once the process is complete or if an error occurs, the lock file is removed to allow subsequent processing.

Usage
To use the utility, execute it from the command line with the following syntax:


<program_name> <E/D> <filename> <keyfile>
<program_name>: The name of the compiled Rust executable.
<E/D>: The action to be performed. Use E for encryption and D for decryption.
<filename>: The path to the data file that you want to encrypt or decrypt.
<keyfile>: The path to the key file to be used for encryption or decryption. The key file must be at least as long as the data file.

Example
To encrypt a file named data.txt using a key file named key.bin, run:




program_name E data.txt key.bin
To decrypt the same file, run:



program_name D data.txt key.bin
How It Works
Upon execution, the program first checks that the provided files exist. If the data file or key file is not found, an error message is displayed, and the program terminates. It then creates a lock file to prevent other instances from processing the same file concurrently. The program checks the length of the key file to ensure it is at least as long as the data file. If this condition is not met, the program terminates with an error.

The core functionality is handled in the process_file function, which reads the data file and key file in chunks, performing the XOR operation on each byte of the data file with the corresponding byte from the key file. The processed data is written to a temporary file, which is then renamed to replace the original data file upon successful completion. If any errors occur during processing, the temporary file is removed to avoid leaving partial or corrupted data behind.

Error Handling
The program includes comprehensive error handling to manage various potential issues, such as missing files, insufficient key length, and concurrent access attempts. It provides clear and informative error messages to help users understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

Lock File Management
A LockFileGuard structure is used to manage the lock file's lifecycle. This structure ensures that the lock file is created at the beginning of the process and removed when the process completes, even if an error occurs. This mechanism prevents multiple instances of the program from accessing and potentially corrupting the same file simultaneously.

Conclusion
This utility provides a simple yet effective way to encrypt and decrypt files using the XOR cipher method. It ensures data integrity and process safety through robust error handling and file locking mechanisms. This program can be extended or modified to suit more specific needs or to incorporate more advanced encryption methods.
