 This readme is a W.I.P
 
 utility apps, example code and more. Code for the discerning Rust coder. 

1- Returns Sha-3-512 hash value for any string. windows.  Readme in the directory. 

2- CLI otp app -WIP

3- AES makes another file, does not overwrite WIP 

4- Console txtcolors

5- list of rust videos-- will replace this with something better

6- Scan- scans any file, generates report that lists how many of each extended ascii chars in the file. 

7- Key maker- run 10 1000 will make 10 keys of 1000 bytes. 

8- simple encryption- no external key, no requested password. It only asks for a file name, and then processes the file.

9- This Rust script makes 10,000 files in the blink of an eye and fills each one with random binary input. It is pretty much useless- that is unless you want a rust script that makes 10,000 files and puts some random chars in each one- in which case you are in luck.

10- simple rust encryption. It asks for a file name then encrypts the file. Run it again, it decrypts the file. Extremely fast.
