 This readme is a W.I.P
 
 utility apps, example code and more. Code for the discerning Rust coder. 

1- Returns Sha-3-512 hash value for any string. windows.  Readme in the directory. 

2- CLI otp app -WIP

3- AES makes another file, does not overwrite WIP 

4- Console txtcolors

5- list of rust videos-- will replace this with something better

6- Scan- scans any file, generates report that lists how many of each extended ascii chars in the file. 

7- Key maker- run 10 1000 will make 10 keys of 1000 bytes. 

8- simple encryption- no external key, no requested password. It only asks for a file name, and then processes the file.

9- This Rust script makes 10,000 files in the blink of an eye and fills each one with random binary input. It is pretty much useless- that is unless you want a rust script that makes 10,000 files and puts some random chars in each one- in which case you are in luck.

10- simple rust encryption. It asks for a file name then encrypts the file. Run it again, it decrypts the file. Extremely fast.

11- A console game in Rust

12- The Rust code generates a random 256-bit (32-byte) key for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher.

13- This script uses the std::fs::File and std::io modules to read and write files, and prompts the user for input using the std::io::stdin() function. It reads the contents of the specified file into a Vec, encrypts or decrypts the contents using a simple XOR cipher with the specified password, and writes the encrypted or decrypted contents back to the file.

14- The code is a simple command-line application written in Rust that takes a file name and password from the user, reads the contents of the specified file, encrypts or decrypts the contents using the XOR cipher algorithm with the provided password, and writes the result back to the file. The code also uses the zeroize crate to zeroize sensitive data (such as the file name, password, and file contents) from memory after they are no longer needed.

15- The file-encrypter program is a command line utility that allows a user to encrypt or decrypt the contents of a file using a password.

16- The program is a simple command-line tool that allows the user to encrypt or decrypt the contents of a file using a key file. When the program is run, it displays a menu with three options: encrypt, decrypt, or exit. If the user selects the encrypt or decrypt option, the program prompts them to enter the name of the file they want to operate on and the name of the key file.

17- One Time Pad 

18- This script defines a constant named SHRED_DIR [./shred] that specifies the name of the directory where the files to be encrypted are located. NOTE- this is ONE WAY encryption. There is NO decryption. DO NOT put anything in the shred directory that you want to save. There are NO take backs!

19- another file shredder

20  Yet  another file shredder
