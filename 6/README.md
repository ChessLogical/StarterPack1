# Scan

When you compile and run this it needs a filename of a file. (./scan rust.txt or scan rust.txt ) It then creates a new file called report.txt that lists every extended ascii charachter, and lists how many instances of each extended ascii charachter are in the file that it asked for. 

for example- 
I used a keymake program to generate a file that is 976.663 kb.  The key maker was made for OTP (one time pad) crypto method so it was instructed to not include the binary null char.  I then ran scan to check the key, and it output report.txt.
