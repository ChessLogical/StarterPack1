This Rust program is a SHA3-512 hash calculator that takes user input, validates it, computes its SHA3-512 hash, and displays the result. Here's a detailed breakdown:

Functionality Overview
User Interaction: The program runs in a loop, continually prompting the user to input a word or number.
Input Handling: After the user inputs data, the program trims any leading or trailing whitespace.
Exit Condition: If the user inputs "q", the program exits.
Input Validation: The program checks if the input is empty and returns an error message if it is.
Hash Calculation: For valid input, the program calculates the SHA3-512 hash.
Output: It then converts the hash to a hexadecimal string and prints it to the console.
Error Handling: The program gracefully handles any errors that might occur during input reading or validation, displaying an appropriate error message.
Detailed Component Description
Imports
std::io::{self, Write}: Facilitates standard input/output operations.
tiny_keccak::{Hasher, Sha3}: Provides SHA3 hashing functionality.
hex: Enables conversion of binary data to hexadecimal representation.
Constants
HASH_OUTPUT_SIZE: Set to 64, denoting the byte size of the SHA3-512 hash output.
Functions
read_input
Purpose: Reads a line of user input after displaying a specified prompt.
Implementation: Uses print! for the prompt, ensuring itâ€™s immediately displayed with flush(). It then reads a line of input, trims it, and returns it.
Error Handling: Propagates any I/O errors to the caller.
validate_input
Purpose: Ensures the user input is non-empty.
Implementation: Checks if the input is empty and returns an error message if it is.
Extensibility: Additional validation rules can be added as needed.
calculate_sha3_512
Purpose: Computes the SHA3-512 hash of a given input string.
Implementation: Utilizes the tiny_keccak library to perform the hash computation, returning the result as a 64-byte array.
main
Loop: Continually prompts the user for input until "q" is entered.
Input Processing: Reads user input, validates it, and if valid, computes and displays the hash.
Error Handling: Any errors during input reading or validation result in an error message, and in case of input reading errors, the program exits.
Exit: Prints "Goodbye!" and exits when "q" is entered.
Conclusion
This program provides a simple, user-friendly interface for calculating SHA3-512 hashes of words or numbers, ensuring robust error handling and clear user guidance throughout its operation.
