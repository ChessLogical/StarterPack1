This is 19-shredder with improved memory handling.


 Shread me once, shame on me. Shred me twice (or more) shame on you :)  

Fun fact- the "RECYCLE BIN" is a way to collect all of your data and spy on you. Some companies could tell you what you deleted on this day 11 years ago. Let that sink in. 

This script defines a constant named SHRED_DIR [./shred] that specifies the name of the directory where the files to be encrypted are located. NOTE- this is ONE WAY encryption. There is NO decryption. DO NOT put anything in the shred directory that you want to save. There are NO take backs! 

Here is an updated version of the xor() function that uses safe memory allocation and safer ways of accessing array elements:

fn xor(data: &mut [u8], key: &[u8]) {
    let key_len = key.len();
    for (i, byte) in data.iter_mut().enumerate() {
        let key_byte = key[i % key_len];
        *byte ^= key_byte;
    }
}


This version uses an iterator to iterate over each byte in the data array, and uses the enumerate() method to get the index of each byte. It then uses a separate variable to store the key byte for each iteration, rather than repeatedly indexing the key array with the modulo operator. Finally, it uses the ^= operator to perform the XOR operation between each byte in the data array and the corresponding byte in the key array.
