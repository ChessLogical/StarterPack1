file maker
Rust app 

[dependencies]
fastrand = "2.0.1"

This Rust script makes 10,000 files in the blink of an eye and fills each one with random binary input. It is
pretty much useless- that is unless you want a rust script that makes 10,000 files and puts some random chars in each  one- in which case you are in luck.
