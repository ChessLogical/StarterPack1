# 11- game dev

<br><br>

A console game in Rust 

[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.4"



This is an incredibly simple game coded in Rust. It comes up with a number, then you guess what the number is. It will tell you
if you are too low or to high and you guess again. 

After you run this and make any slight change, it is now completely legal for you to write on your resimue that
you have Rust game dev experience. You are welcome :)
