To set the background color, you can use the escape code \x1b[48;2;r;g;b, where r, g, and b are the red, green, and blue color 
components respectively.

In this code, we use the escape code \x1b[48;2;r;g;b to set the background color. We also use the escape code \x1b[38;2;r;g;b to set the text color.

Note that some terminals may not support changing the background color using ANSI escape codes, and the exact colors displayed may vary depending on the
terminal being used.

When you run this program, you should see the text with different colors and background colors printed to the console, followed by a prompt to press Enter. 
The program will wait for the user to press Enter before exiting.

ps- look at the photo. The colors are not what they say they are. If you noticed that, you are a good programmer. If you did not notice it, let that
serve as a lesson. NEVER rely on lies that are right in front of your face. Everything is a lie. Every line of code could be a lie. Every compiler error could
be a lie. Train your mind to have ZERO assumptions.
